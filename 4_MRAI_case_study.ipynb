    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Heart disease is the leading cause of death globally. __Heart failure__ is the primary cause of heart diseases, and that refers to a physiological state in which the heart is unable to pump sufficiently to maintain blood flow to meet the body's need. It usually occurs because the heart has become too weak or stiff. \n",
    "\n",
    "HF is routinely diagnosed by:\n",
    "* __Electrocardiogram (ECG)__, which measure heart's rhythm and electrical activity. From the ECG the QRS duration can be computed. An increased QRS duration, indicate dyssynchronous contraction and relaxation of the left and right ventricles and it is a marker of detection of HF subjects.\n",
    "* __MRI__ or __US imaging__ which provides structural and functional information of the heart. Evaluation of the structure and the function of the ventricles can provide useful information for diagnosis and characterization of disease. \n",
    " \t \t\n",
    "Based on the result of these tests, doctors use NYHA class to classify patients' heart failure according to the severity of their symptoms:\n",
    "\n",
    "__Class I__: no limitation is experienced in any activities; there are no symptoms from ordinary activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Class II__: slight, mild limitation of activity; the patient is comfortable at rest or with mild exertion.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Class III__: marked limitation of any activity; the patient is comfortable only at rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Class IV__: any physical activity brings on discomfort and symptoms occur at rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Current diagnostic technique\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, the parameters used in clinics to identify cardiac patients are:\n",
    "* __LVEDV__ which is the maximum amount of blood that heart can pump\n",
    "* __LVESV__ which is the minium amount of blood that heart can pump\n",
    "* __LVSV__ which is the amount of blood pumped by the left ventricle of the heart in one contraction. \n",
    "* __Ejection fraction (LVEF)__, which computes the amount of blood of the left ventricle (LV) pumps out with each contraction. A normal heart’s ejection fraction may be between 50 and 70 percent.\n"
